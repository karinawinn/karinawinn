# Karina Winn

Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karina Winn, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in physics, engineering, programming, and music. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I am a passionate learner currently diving into the worlds of thermal/statistical physics and quantum mechanics. I have also been expanding my programming knowledge
learning about data structures such as stacks, queues, sets, and linked lists. My ultimate goal is to merge my love for music with my love for physics by pursuing 
graduate studies in acoustics, where I hope to deepen my understanding of sound and its applications. In the future, I aspire to work on innovative acoustic systems, 
combining my technical skills and academic knowledge to contribute to advancements in this fascinating field.

## Technologies and Tools

I am proficient in two programming languages: python and C#. I have extensively used Mathematica throughout my education to solve various complex physics and math problems,
including solving differential equations and partial differential equations using both analytical and matrix-based methods. I have experience creating detailed 3D models using 
AutoCAD, SOLIDWORKS, and Autodesk Civil3D and have experience with various types of lab equipment and microcontrollers.
